Lab 4 Code Walk
---------------

Walk thru 1: simpledb.Parser.main() and simpledb.Parser.start()

	simpledb.Parser.main() is the entry point for the SimpleDB system. It calls simpledb.Parser.start(). The latter performs three main actions:
		1) It populates the SimpleDB catalog from the catalog text file provided by the user as argument (Database.getCatalog().loadSchema(argv[0]);).
		2) For each table defined in the system catalog, it computes statistics over the data in the table by calling: TableStats.computeStatistics(), which then does: TableStats s = new TableStats(tableid, IOCOSTPERPAGE);
		3) It processes the statements submitted by the user (processNextStatement(new ByteArrayInputStream(statementBytes));)

Walk thru 2: simpledb.Parser.processNextStatement()

	This method takes in the user input and attempts to parse it as SQL, using
	the Zql parsing library.  This method handles bad user input, as well as valid SQL statements include INSERT, DELETE, and SELECT statements.  

	We focus on the SELECT statement which is handled by 
		handleQueryStatement((ZQuery)s)
	This returns a Query object, which is then executed by calling
		query.execute();

Walk thru 3: simpledb.Parser.handleQueryStatement()

Walk thru 4: simpledb.Parser.parseQueryLogicalPlan()

	<fill this in>

	Note: this method is rather long and complex.  Your walk thru should focus
	on the high-level ideas.  Specifically, explain how SQL query is processed to construct the LogicalPlan.  
 
Walk thru 5: simpledb.LogicalPlan.physicalPlan()

	Your walk thru should explain how these data structures are used:
		- equivMap
		- filterSelectivities
		- statsMap
		- subplanMap

Walk thru 6: simpledb.JoinOptimizer.orderJoins()

	<fill this in>

Walk thru 7: JoinOptimizer.computeCostAndCardOfSubplan()

	<fill this in>

Walk thru 8: JoinOptimizer.estimateJoinCost()

	<fill this in>

Walk thru 9: JoinOptimizer.estimateJoinCardinality()

	<fill this in>

Walk thru 10 query.execute()
	
	Note: This is called inside simpledb.Parser.processNextStatement().  Refer back to Walk thru 2.

Questions
---------

Answer these questions.  With each question is a hint as to which part of the code walk you might consult to find the answer.

(Walk thru 1) How many instances of the TableStats class are created?

(Walk thru 4) In class, we said a logical plan is a relational algebra tree.  That's not how it's represented in SimpleDB.  How is it represented? 

(Walk thru 5) The physicalPlan is a relational algebra tree.  Describe the basic shape of this tree in terms of which ops go where.

(Walk thru 5) Suppose a query applies multiple filters to a single table.  For example, the query described in the lab write up filters on both actor first and last name.  In such cases, how is the selectivity estimated?  

(Walk thru 5) Explain the meaning of this if statement.  Why should the subplanMap have size 0 or 1 at this point?

    if (subplanMap.size() > 1) {
        throw new ParsingException("Query does not include join expressions joining all nodes!");
    }

(Walk thru 7) What does computeCostAndCardOfSubplan do when the joinSet contains only a single join, the joinToRemove?

(Walk thru 9) Suppose we are considering a join between a table A and the result of a join between B and C.  Assume table A is the outer relation in the join.  What is the cost estimate?  Your expression should be in terms of the sizes (# pages, # tuples) of the base relations A, B, C.

(Walk thru 10) In lab 3, you write Join and Filter operators.  Both of these support the DbIterator interface.  When/where are these iterators called?

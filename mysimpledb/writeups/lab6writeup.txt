Report for Lab 6
----------------

Exercise 1.

1. Briefly explain how logging is done in SimpleDB by describing when
   log records are written to the log.  Use Eclipse search tools to find
   all uses of the LogFile methods in the SimpleDB source code.

   	When the transaction starts, a BEGIN is written to the log. When
   	the transaction either commits or aborts, the corresponding COMMIT or
   	ABORT is written to the log. When a page is flushed, an UPDATE is written
   	to the log. And when a log shuts down, a checkpoint is written so that
   	everything gets flushed to disk.


2. Where is LogFile.force called?  You should include usages inside other
   LogFile methods.  For each usage, why is it important that force is called?

    Basically, force() is called whenever data is being written to disk.
    Specifically, it is called in BufferPool.flushPage(), and in logAbort(),
    logCheckpoint(), and logCommit(); all these methods write data to disk.


3. Where is setBeforeImage image called?  

    In BufferPool.transactionComplete().


Exercise 4.

In answering the next few questions, oncy include method calls in the source
code; method calls in the test code can be ignored.

4. Where is BufferPool.flushPage called?

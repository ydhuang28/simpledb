After you complete lab 1, please answer the following questions.  For lab 1, the questions are simple but in future labs you can expect to spend some time answering more detailed questions about the design of your solution.

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

It was rigorous and challenging but fun.

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

HeapFile implementation. I had a hard time trying to grasp readPage().

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

Not particularly. All tests pass and Lab1Main runs successfully.

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

I would say around 10-12 hours. But I might have overcounted.
